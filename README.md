# Machine-Leaning-Pipeline-From-Scratch

Build complete ML Algorithms and Pipelines

## 1- Data Exploration

I use [Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumargh/pimaindiansdiabetescsv) in this project. 

In this file, first open CSV file with different methods such as Numpy, Pandas. 

Then check data dimension, type of attributes, summary, class distribution, pairwise pearson correlation, skew of each attribute and info. 

## 2- Data Visualization

Visualize data using matplotlib.

Histogram, Density Plots, Box and Whisker Plots, Correlation Matrix Plot, Scatterplot Matrix.

## 3- Data Preparation

Prepare data before performing any ML algorithms on it. 

The data is usually not ready to be used in a ML model, therefore preparing it is important. 

There are multiple methods such as Rescaling, Standardization, Normalization, Binarization to prepare the data for a ML model and should choose depending on the model you want to use.
